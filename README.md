# Dotfiles

This repository contains all of my dotfiles and global configuration.

I'm using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">stow</a> to automatically symlink the relevant configuration folders to their correct locations.

I'm also using brew and npm to globally install dependencies.

The `install` script will install all configurations and can optionally also install common dependencies like nodemon, prettier, bat, awscli, and so forth.
